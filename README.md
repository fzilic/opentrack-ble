# Arduino Nano 33 Sense BLE Rev 2 Head tracking

This was a good idea on paper.
It could have been a cool wireless head tracking solution I'm not using VR.

But nope.

I picked the wrong idea.

To any future reader - Arduino Nano 33 BLE **DOES NOT SUPPORT** classic Bluetooth and Bluetooth Serial.

This is an example how to do stuff, not great, not finished, and it will **never** be finished.
